# GitHub Actions - Automated Deployment

## What This Does

Automatically deploys to Vercel on every push to `master` or `main` branch.

**Zero manual deployment commands needed after setup.**

---

## One-Time Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Vercel Token

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Name: "GitHub Actions"
4. Scope: Full Account
5. Copy token (starts with `vercel_...`)

### Step 2: Get Vercel Project IDs

Run these commands locally (after first manual deploy):

```bash
# First, deploy manually once to create project:
npx vercel --prod

# Then get the IDs:
vercel project ls
# Copy your project ID

# Get org ID:
cat .vercel/project.json
# Copy "orgId" value
```

OR use these commands after linking:

```bash
# Link project
vercel link

# Get values from .vercel/project.json
cat .vercel/project.json
```

You'll see:
```json
{
  "orgId": "team_xxxxx",
  "projectId": "prj_xxxxx"
}
```

### Step 3: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repo: `https://github.com/RicardoM431/screenshot-api`
2. Go to: **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click: **New repository secret**
4. Add these 3 secrets:

| Secret Name | Value | Where to Get |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | `vercel_xxxxx` | Step 1 above |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | `team_xxxxx` | Step 2 - from project.json |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `prj_xxxxx` | Step 2 - from project.json |

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin master
```

**Done!** GitHub Actions will automatically deploy.

## How It Works

### Trigger

Runs automatically when you:
- Push to `master` or `main` branch
- Manually trigger from Actions tab

### What It Does

1. âœ… Checks out code
2. âœ… Installs Node.js 18
3. âœ… Installs dependencies
4. âœ… Builds project
5. âœ… Installs Vercel CLI
6. âœ… Pulls Vercel config
7. âœ… Builds for production
8. âœ… Deploys to Vercel
9. âœ… Comments deployment URL on commit

### Result

Every commit gets:
- Automatic deployment
- Comment with live URL
- Build status badge

---

## Viewing Deployments

### GitHub Actions Tab

1. Go to repo â†’ **Actions** tab
2. See all deployments
3. Click on run to see logs
4. View deployment URL in logs

### Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. See all deployments
4. View logs, analytics, etc.

---

## Workflow Status Badge

Add to your README.md:

```markdown
[![Deploy](https://github.com/RicardoM431/screenshot-api/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RicardoM431/screenshot-api/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
```

Shows deployment status on your README.

---

## Manual Trigger

You can also trigger deployments manually:

1. Go to: **Actions** tab
2. Select: **Deploy to Vercel**
3. Click: **Run workflow**
4. Select branch
5. Click: **Run workflow**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "VERCEL_TOKEN not found"

**Fix:** Make sure you added the secret in GitHub repo settings.

### "Project not found"

**Fix:**
1. Run `npx vercel --prod` locally once
2. This creates the project on Vercel
3. Then get the project ID and add to secrets

### "Build failed"

**Fix:** Check Actions logs for error details. Common issues:
- Missing dependencies in package.json
- TypeScript errors
- Environment variables missing

### Deployment succeeds but site doesn't work

**Fix:** Check Vercel logs for runtime errors:
1. Vercel dashboard â†’ Your project â†’ Logs
2. Look for errors after deployment

## Benefits

âœ… **Fully automated** - No manual commands
âœ… **Fast** - ~2 minute deploys
âœ… **Reliable** - GitHub + Vercel infrastructure
âœ… **Free** - No costs
âœ… **History** - All deployments tracked
âœ… **Rollback** - Easy to revert
âœ… **Status** - See deployment status in GitHub

---

## Development Workflow

After setup, your workflow is:

```bash
# Make changes
vim src/index.ts

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"

# Push - triggers auto-deploy
git push

# Done! Check Actions tab for deployment URL
```

**No deployment commands needed!**

---

## Advanced: Preview Deployments

Want preview URLs for PRs? Add this workflow:

`.github/workflows/preview.yml`:

```yaml
name: Preview Deployment

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
      - main

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm install --global vercel@latest
      - run: vercel deploy --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} > deployment-url.txt
      - run: |
          URL=$(cat deployment-url.txt)
          echo "Preview: $URL" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

Now every PR gets a preview URL!

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Complete one-time setup above
2. âœ… Push to GitHub
3. âœ… Watch Actions tab
4. âœ… Get deployment URL
5. âœ… Share and validate!

After this, all future updates auto-deploy on push.

**Fully autonomous deployment achieved!** ðŸŽ‰
