---

## 🏁 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Setup Formspree (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://formspree.io/register
2. Create account
3. Create form: "Screenshot API Waitlist"
4. Copy form ID (looks like: `myzabc123`)
5. Edit `public/index.html` line 104:
   - Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your form ID
6. Save file

### Step 2: Deploy (10 minutes)

**Option A: Railway** (recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
railway domain
```

**Option B: Vercel** (easier)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

Copy your deployed URL!

### Step 3: Start Validation (Day 1)

1. Open `VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Follow Day 1 tasks
3. Post to Reddit (r/webdev, r/SideProject)
4. Start Twitter thread
5. Track signups: `npm run metrics`

4. Post on scheduled platforms
5. Respond to all comments (within 2 hours)
6. Share progress on Twitter

```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After 7 days:

## 🔥 Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Test locally (http://localhost:3000)

# Validation
npm run metrics          # Check signup count
npm run metrics update 5 # Update count to 5

# Deployment
railway up               # Deploy to Railway
vercel --prod           # Deploy to Vercel
```

---

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

1. **Must deploy before sharing** - Landing page must be live
2. **Must setup Formspree first** - Email collection won't work otherwise
3. **Respond to comments quickly** - Within 2 hours is ideal
4. **Track metrics daily** - Use `npm run metrics update`
5. **Don't build until validated** - This is the whole point!

---

## 📅 Timeline

- **Right now**: Setup Formspree + Deploy
- **Day 1-7**: Execute validation plan
- **Day 7**: Make decision (build or pivot)
- **Week 2-3**: Build (if validated)
- **Week 4**: Launch

---

## 💡 Why This Works

Traditional approach:
- Build for 3 months → Launch → Fail → Wasted time

This approach:
- Validate in 7 days → Only build if validated → Higher success rate

**Time saved if idea fails**: 3 months → 7 days

---
