## Title
Screenshot API - $9/mo for 1,000 screenshots - Before I build it, who needs this?

## Post Content

**Project**: Screenshot API
**Status**: Validation phase (not built yet!)
**Goal**: 50 signups in 7 days ‚Üí then I build it

---

### What It Is

Dead simple API to convert URLs to screenshot images:

```
POST /v1/capture
{"url": "https://example.com"}

‚Üí Returns screenshot image URL
```

### Why I'm Building This

I needed this for my own side project (generating social media previews). Found existing solutions cost $30-50/mo. That's too expensive for a side project making $0-100/mo.

So I'm building a cheaper alternative: **$9/mo for 1,000 screenshots**.

### The Catch

I'm **NOT building it until I validate demand**.

Here's my validation plan:
- Create full API docs + landing page ‚úÖ
- Share everywhere and collect signups üèÉ (you are here)
- If I get 50+ signups in 7 days ‚Üí I build it
- If not ‚Üí I try a different idea

### Pricing

- Free: 100/month (testing/hobby)
- $9/mo: 1,000/month (side projects)
- $29/mo: 10,000/month (small SaaS)
- $99/mo: 100,000/month (production)

### Use Cases

‚úÖ Social media preview cards (my use case)
‚úÖ Portfolio thumbnails
‚úÖ Website monitoring
‚úÖ Link previews in chat apps
‚úÖ Documentation screenshots

### What I Need From You

1. **Would you actually use this?** (be brutally honest)
2. **Is $9/mo reasonable?** (or too expensive?)
3. **What's missing?** (what features would you need?)

### Validation-First Approach

I've learned the hard way: **don't build until validated**.

Previous mistakes:
- Built a podcast tool ‚Üí 0 paying users (wasted 3 months)
- Built a CRM ‚Üí 2 trials, 0 conversions (wasted 6 months)

This time: validate first, build second.

If this idea sucks, I'll find out in 7 days, not 7 months.

---

**TL;DR**: Screenshot API, $9/mo, validation-first. Would you use it?

## Comment Response Templates

**Positive Feedback:**
"Thanks! Yeah, the validation-first approach is new for me after wasting months on unvalidated ideas. Fingers crossed this one resonates."

**Critical Feedback:**
"Appreciate the honesty. That's exactly why I'm validating first - better to learn in 7 days than 7 months. What kind of API would you actually pay for?"

**Pricing Concerns:**
"That's fair feedback. I'm trying to find the sweet spot between affordable and sustainable. If multiple people say price is too high, I'll adjust before building."

**Technical Questions:**
"Good question! Planning to use [tech stack]. But honestly, not diving deep into architecture until I validate demand. No point over-engineering something nobody wants."
