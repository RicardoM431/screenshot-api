# Building a Screenshot API: Docs First, Code Second

I'm building a Screenshot API. But I haven't written a single line of code yet.

Here's why.

## The Problem with "Just Build It"

I've shipped failed products before:

- **Podcast tool**: 3 months of development → 0 paying users
- **CRM for freelancers**: 6 months of work → 2 trials, 0 conversions

Total time wasted: **9 months**.

The pattern? I built first, validated later.

This time, I'm flipping it: **Validate first, build second.**

## The Idea: Screenshot API

Simple concept: Convert any URL to a screenshot via API call.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.screenshotapi.dev/v1/capture \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'

# Returns: {"image_url": "https://cdn.../screenshot.png"}
```

### Use Cases
- Social media preview cards
- Portfolio thumbnails
- Website monitoring
- Link preview services

### Market Gap

Existing solutions charge **$30-50/mo** for 1,000 screenshots.

My hypothesis: There's a market for a **cheaper alternative at $9/mo**.

But is that hypothesis correct? Let's validate.

## My Validation Plan

Instead of building for weeks, I'm validating in **7 days**:

### Day 1-2: Create Documentation

✅ Full API documentation (even though API doesn't exist)
✅ Landing page with pricing
✅ Email collection form

**Why docs first?**

Writing documentation forces you to think through:
- API design decisions
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- User experience

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet.

### Day 3-4: Distribution

Share everywhere:
- Reddit (r/webdev, r/SideProject, r/API)
- Dev.to (this article!)
- Hacker News (Show HN)
- Twitter (#buildinpublic)
- Product Hunt Ship

**Goal**: Drive traffic to landing page.

### Day 5-7: Track Metrics

Collect email signups.

**Decision criteria:**
- **50+ signups** → BUILD IT ✅
- **25-49 signups** → Adjust pricing/messaging, retry
- **<25 signups** → PIVOT to different idea ❌

## Why This Works

### 1. Fast Feedback Loop

7 days to validate vs 7 months to build + fail.

### 2. Real Signal

Email signups are weak signal (not paying customers). But it's better than no signal.

If I can't get 50 people to enter their email, I definitely can't get them to pay $9/mo.

### 3. Psychological Commitment

Public commitment = accountability.

By sharing this article, I'm forcing myself to follow through.

### 4. Pre-Launch Marketing

Even if I build it, I need distribution anyway.

This validation process doubles as pre-launch marketing.

## The Tech Stack (If I Build It)

Only sharing this because it's interesting, **but I'm not building until validated**:

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Screenshots**: Puppeteer
- **Image optimization**: Sharp
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 (cheaper than S3)
- **Caching**: Redis (24-hour cache = cost savings)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Deploy**: Railway.app

Estimated build time: **2-3 weeks** (if I use Claude Code for AI-assisted development).

But again, not building until validated.

## Pricing Strategy

| Plan | Screenshots/mo | Price |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Free | 100 | $0 |
| Starter | 1,000 | $9 |
| Growth | 10,000 | $29 |
| Scale | 100,000 | $99 |

**Competitive positioning**: 70% cheaper than existing solutions.

**Risk**: Race to the bottom on pricing.

**Mitigation**: Superior developer experience, better docs, faster response times.

## What I'm Learning So Far

*[Update this section after 3-4 days of validation]*

Day 3 update:
- X signups so far
- Main feedback: [summary]
- Biggest concern: [issue]
- Surprising insight: [learning]

## How You Can Help

1. **Brutal honesty**: Would you actually use this? Why or why not?
2. **Pricing feedback**: Is $9/mo reasonable?
3. **Feature requests**: What's missing?
4. **Share**: If this resonates, share with someone who might need it

*(No credit card required, just email for waitlist)*

## The Validation-First Playbook

Here's my framework for any new idea:

### Week 1: Validate
- [ ] Write comprehensive docs
- [ ] Create landing page
- [ ] Set collection goal (50 signups)
- [ ] Share everywhere
- [ ] Track metrics daily

### Week 2-3: Build (Only if Validated)
- [ ] Core API functionality
- [ ] Payment integration
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Week 4: Launch
- [ ] Email waitlist
- [ ] Product Hunt launch
- [ ] Monitor & fix bugs

**Total time investment if idea fails**: 1 week instead of 3 months.

## Lessons from Past Failures

### Failed Product #1: Podcast Tool

**What I did wrong:**
- Built for 3 months before getting feedback
- Assumed I understood user needs
- No validation, no pre-launch marketing

**What I should have done:**
- Created landing page with mockups
- Collected emails before building
- Interviewed potential users

### Failed Product #2: CRM

**What I did wrong:**
- Over-engineered (built every feature I could imagine)
- Launched to crickets (no distribution plan)
- Pricing was too high ($49/mo)

**What I should have done:**
- Built MVP only
- Pre-launch marketing
- Started cheaper, increased price later

## This Time Is Different

**Then**: Build → Launch → Hope for users
**Now**: Validate → Build → Launch to waitlist

**Then**: 3-6 months wasted on bad ideas
**Now**: 7 days to validate, only build if validated

**Then**: Solo in silence
**Now**: Building in public

## Join the Journey

I'm documenting this validation experiment:

- **Twitter**: [your_handle] (#buildinpublic)
- **GitHub**: [repo link]
- **Landing page**: [YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL]

Follow along to see if this validation-first approach works.

Day 7 update: I'll write a follow-up article with results.

## Questions?

Drop them in the comments. I'll respond to everyone.

**TL;DR**: Building Screenshot API. Validating demand in 7 days before writing code. Need 50 signups to proceed. Lessons from past failures.

## Publishing Strategy

### Timing
- **Best day**: Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Best time**: 8am-10am EST (when devs drink coffee)

### Promotion After Publishing

**Immediately:**
- Share on Twitter with thread
- Post to r/webdev (link to article)
- Share in indie hacker communities

**Day 2-3:**
- Respond to every comment
- Add "Day 3 Update" section with metrics
- Share progress on Twitter

**Day 7:**
- Write follow-up article with results
- Either: "50+ signups! Here's how I'll build it"
- Or: "Only 20 signups. Here's what I learned"

### Comment Engagement

Respond to every comment within 2-4 hours.

**Positive comments:**
"Thanks! Yeah, the validation-first mindset is hard to adopt but so valuable. Wish I'd learned this earlier."

**Critical comments:**
"Really appreciate the honest feedback. That's exactly why I'm validating - better to hear this now than after building."

**Technical questions:**
"Great question! [detailed answer]. This kind of feedback is gold for refining the API design."

**Pricing concerns:**
"Fair point. I'm testing $9/mo but open to adjusting based on feedback. What price point would work for you?"

## Success Metrics

- 100+ reactions (likes/unicorns)
- 500+ views in first 24 hours
- 20+ comments
- 10+ waitlist signups from Dev.to
- Getting featured on Dev.to homepage
