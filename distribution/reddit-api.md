## Title
Screenshot API - Market validation before development - Feedback wanted

## Post Content

I'm working on a Screenshot API and seeking feedback before building it.

### Endpoint

```http
POST https://api.screenshotapi.dev/v1/capture
Authorization: Bearer API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "width": 1280,
  "height": 800,
  "format": "png"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "image_url": "https://cdn.screenshotapi.dev/abc123.png",
  "credits_used": 1,
  "credits_remaining": 999
}
```

### Planned Features

- Multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- Full-page screenshots
- Custom viewport sizes
- 24-hour caching (save costs)
- Global CDN delivery
- Rate limiting per tier

### Pricing

| Plan | Screenshots/mo | Price |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Free | 100 | $0 |
| Starter | 1,000 | $9 |
| Growth | 10,000 | $29 |
| Scale | 100,000 | $99 |

### Tech Stack (Planned)

- Node.js + Puppeteer
- Sharp (image optimization)
- Cloudflare R2 (storage + CDN)
- Redis (caching layer)
- Stripe (payments)

### Why I'm Posting Here

I'm following a validation-first approach:
1. Create full API documentation ✅
2. Collect 50+ waitlist signups ⏳
3. Build the API (only if validated) ❌

**I'm not building until I validate demand.**

### Questions for r/API

1. **API Design**: Any issues with the endpoint structure?
2. **Pricing**: Competitive compared to existing solutions?
3. **Features**: What's missing that you'd need?
4. **Authentication**: API key in header sufficient, or need OAuth?
5. **Rate Limits**: Free tier gets 10 req/min. Reasonable?

### Competitive Analysis

Existing solutions:
- ApiFlash: $50/mo for 1,000 screenshots
- Screenshotlayer: $30/mo for 1,000 screenshots
- ScreenshotAPI: $29/mo for 1,000 screenshots

My positioning: **Simpler + Cheaper** ($9/mo)

### Documentation

Full API docs (even though API doesn't exist yet): [YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL]

Trying to follow REST best practices. Feedback welcome.

**TL;DR**: Screenshot API, validation-first, seeking technical feedback on design.

## When to Post

- **Best days**: Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best times**: 10am-2pm EST
- **Why**: r/API has technical audience, active during work hours

## Engagement Strategy

This is a **technical subreddit**. They want:
- Clean API design
- Technical details
- Best practices
- Architecture decisions

**Avoid marketing speak.**

Focus on:
- RESTful design
- Error handling
- Rate limiting strategy
- Authentication approach
- Caching architecture

## Technical Questions to Prepare For

**Q: "Why API key in header instead of query param?"**
A: "Security best practice. Query params get logged in server logs and browser history. Headers are more secure for auth tokens."

**Q: "What about webhooks for async processing?"**
A: "Good idea! For v1 I'm keeping it simple (synchronous). But webhooks make sense for full-page screenshots that take 10+ seconds. Would you use webhooks?"

**Q: "How do you handle timeouts?"**
A: "30 second timeout per request. If target site doesn't load, return 504 with error details. Planning to add retry logic + callback URL for complex pages."

**Q: "CORS support?"**
A: "API is backend-only (CORS not needed). For frontend use, I could add a proxy endpoint. Is that a use case you need?"

**Q: "Versioning strategy?"**
A: "URL-based versioning (/v1/, /v2/, etc). Maintain v1 indefinitely, no breaking changes without major version bump."

**Q: "How do you prevent abuse? (crawling, DDOS, etc)"**
A: "Rate limiting per API key, captcha for suspect traffic, block lists for malicious URLs, usage quotas per tier. Open to suggestions!"

**Q: "What about screenshot of localhost?"**
A: "Not possible - API runs on our servers, can only access public URLs. For localhost, you'd need to run Puppeteer locally."

**Q: "OpenAPI spec available?"**
A: "Great idea! I'll create one. Should have thought of that. Thanks for the feedback."

## What r/API Values

✅ Technical accuracy
✅ RESTful design
✅ Clear error messages
✅ Good documentation
✅ Security considerations

❌ Marketing fluff
❌ Unclear pricing
❌ Poor API design
❌ Missing error codes

## Follow-Up Strategy

**If someone suggests improvement:**
"That's a great point. I'll add that to the spec before building. This is exactly why I'm validating first - better to get feedback now than after launch."

**If someone points out flaw:**
"You're absolutely right. I missed that. Thanks for catching it. This is going in v1 design doc."

**If someone compares to competitor:**
"Good comparison. How does [competitor] handle [feature]? I want to learn from what works."

## Success Metrics

- 20+ upvotes = good technical visibility
- 10+ comments with technical feedback
- API design improvements identified
- 5+ waitlist signups (technical audience converts lower)

## Things to Add Based on Feedback

Keep a list of all suggested features:
- Webhooks for async processing
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- SDK libraries (Node, Python, PHP)
- Retry logic + exponential backoff
- Custom headers for authenticated screenshots
- JavaScript rendering options
- PDF output format

Don't promise everything. Just say:
"Great suggestion. I'll prioritize based on validation results."

## After Posting

Create a Google Doc with all feedback:
- API design improvements
- Feature requests
- Technical concerns
- Security considerations

Use this to inform actual build (if validated).
