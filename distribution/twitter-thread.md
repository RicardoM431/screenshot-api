# Twitter Thread Strategy

## Main Thread (Launch Announcement)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I'm building a Screenshot API.

But I'm NOT writing any code yet.

Here's my validation-first approach üßµ
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
The problem: I've wasted 9 months building products nobody wanted.

‚ùå Podcast tool ‚Üí 0 customers (3 months)
‚ùå CRM ‚Üí 2 trials, 0 conversions (6 months)

Pattern: Build first, validate later.

This time: Validate first, build second.
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
The idea: Screenshot API

Simple: POST URL ‚Üí get screenshot

Existing solutions: $30-50/mo
My hypothesis: Market gap at $9/mo

But is there actually demand? Let's find out.
```

### Tweet 4 (Validation Plan)
```
My 7-day validation sprint:

Day 1-2: ‚úÖ Create full API docs + landing page
Day 3-4: ‚è≥ Share everywhere (you are here)
Day 5-7: ‚è≥ Track signups

Goal: 50 signups = validated
Result: <50 = pivot to different idea
```

### Tweet 5 (The Ask)
```
I need YOUR feedback:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Would you use this?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Is $9/mo reasonable?
3Ô∏è‚É£ What's missing?

Landing: [YOUR_URL]

No credit card, just email for waitlist.

RT if you think validation-first is the way üöÄ
```

### Tweet 6 (Building in Public)
```
Following along:

‚úÖ Full API docs (before code exists)
‚úÖ Pricing page
‚úÖ Tech stack planned
‚ùå Zero lines of code

I'll update daily with metrics + learnings.

This is either validation-first genius or public failure theater.

Let's find out together üëÄ
```

### Tweet 7 (Final CTA)
```
Why am I sharing before building?

Because feedback NOW is 1000x more valuable than after launch.

Help me not waste 3 months building something nobody wants.

30 seconds to join waitlist: [YOUR_URL]

Day 7: I'll share results (validated or pivot)

### Day 7 - Results Thread

**If Validated (50+ signups)**:

```
VALIDATION RESULTS üßµ

7 days ago I committed to validate a Screenshot API idea before building.

Goal: 50 signups
Result: [X] signups

‚úÖ VALIDATED

Here's what happened + what's next:
```

```
(2) The numbers:

üìä Total signups: [X]
üë• Total traffic: [X] visits
üìà Conversion rate: [X]%

Distribution breakdown:
‚Ä¢ Reddit: [X] signups
‚Ä¢ HN: [X] signups
‚Ä¢ Twitter: [X] signups
‚Ä¢ Dev.to: [X] signups
```

```
(3) What I learned:

Biggest surprise: [insight]
Most common feedback: [theme]
Unexpected use case: [discovery]
Pricing feedback: [summary]

The validation process forced me to think through things I'd have missed.
```

```
(4) What's next:

Week 1: [task list]
Week 2: [task list]
Week 3: Launch to waitlist

Using Claude Code to accelerate development.

Goal: Fully built in 2-3 weeks.

I'll document the build in public üìù
```

```
(5) Would this work for your idea?

Validation-first framework:
‚Ä¢ Full docs before code
‚Ä¢ Landing page + pricing
‚Ä¢ 7 day sprint
‚Ä¢ Clear success criteria
‚Ä¢ Public commitment

Try it. Share results. Tag me.

üßµ/fin
```

**If NOT Validated (<50 signups)**:

```
VALIDATION RESULTS üßµ

7 days ago I committed to validate a Screenshot API idea.

Goal: 50 signups
Result: [X] signups

‚ùå NOT VALIDATED

Here's what I learned + what's next:
```

```
(2) The numbers:

üìä Total signups: [X] / 50
üë• Total traffic: [X] visits
üìà Conversion rate: [X]%

Not enough market signal to justify building.

This is validation-first working as designed.
```

```
(3) Why it didn't validate:

Theory 1: [hypothesis]
Theory 2: [hypothesis]
Theory 3: [hypothesis]

Common feedback: [themes]

The market spoke. I listened.
```

```
(4) What I learned:

‚Ä¢ [learning 1]
‚Ä¢ [learning 2]
‚Ä¢ [learning 3]

Most valuable: I found out in 7 days, not 7 months.

Validation-first saved me from wasting weeks building.
```

```
(5) What's next:

I'm pivoting to: [next idea]

Why: [reasoning]

Starting validation again next week.

Same process:
‚Ä¢ Docs first
‚Ä¢ Landing page
‚Ä¢ 7 day validation
‚Ä¢ 50 signup goal

Will share journey üìù
```

```
(6) This is what validation-first looks like:

Not every idea works.
That's OK.
Find out fast.
Move on.

Better to validate 10 ideas in 10 weeks than build 1 idea for 10 weeks.

Thanks everyone who gave feedback üôè

## Individual Tweet Ideas (Sprinkle Throughout Week)

### About Validation
```
Hot take:

Writing comprehensive docs BEFORE coding forces you to think through:

‚Ä¢ API design
‚Ä¢ Error handling
‚Ä¢ Edge cases
‚Ä¢ User experience

If you can't explain it clearly, you don't understand it yet.

Docs-first = design-first.
```

### About Pricing
```
Pricing experiment:

Existing screenshot APIs: $30-50/mo

My hypothesis: There's untapped market at $9/mo

‚Ä¢ Solo devs
‚Ä¢ Side projects
‚Ä¢ Bootstrapped startups

Testing if demand exists at this price point before building.

What would YOU pay?
```

### About AI Development
```
Planning to use Claude Code to build this (if validated).

Not because AI writes perfect code.

But because:
‚Ä¢ Faster iteration
‚Ä¢ Better docs
‚Ä¢ Fewer bugs
‚Ä¢ More time for user feedback

AI = force multiplier, not replacement.
```

### About Building in Public
```
Why I'm building in public:

‚úÖ Accountability
‚úÖ Feedback
‚úÖ Pre-launch marketing
‚úÖ Prove validation-first works
‚úÖ Help others avoid my mistakes

Downside: Public failure if this flops.

Worth it.
```

### Poll Tweet
```
Quick poll for developers:

If you needed to generate screenshots from URLs, what would you do?

üîµ Use existing API ($30-50/mo)
üü† Build with Puppeteer yourself
üü¢ Pay $9/mo for simple API
üü° Not worth solving

[poll]
```

### Comparison Tweet
```
My approach vs traditional:

Traditional:
‚Ä¢ Build for 3 months
‚Ä¢ Launch
‚Ä¢ Hope for users
‚Ä¢ Usually fail

Validation-first:
‚Ä¢ Validate for 7 days
‚Ä¢ Only build if validated
‚Ä¢ Launch to waitlist
‚Ä¢ Higher success rate

Front-load the risk.
```

## Example Thread Variations

### Alternative Hook #1
```
I've wasted 9 months building products nobody wanted.

This time: I'm validating FIRST, building SECOND.

Here's my 7-day validation framework üßµ
```

### Alternative Hook #2
```
Most founders: Build for months ‚Üí launch ‚Üí hope

Me: Validate in 7 days ‚Üí only build if validated

Here's how üßµ
```

### Alternative Hook #3
```
Screenshot API: $9/mo vs competitors at $50/mo

Is there demand?

I'm finding out in 7 days before writing any code.

Here's the experiment üßµ
```
