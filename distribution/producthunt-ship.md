## Getting Traction on Ship

### Upvotes Matter
- Ask friends to upvote (not directly, naturally)
- Share in communities
- Engage with other Ship pages (they'll engage back)

### Comments
- Respond to every comment
- Ask questions to drive engagement
- Share progress updates

### Newsletter
Product Hunt will send your updates to subscribers.

**Use this strategically:**
- Don't spam (max 1 update per week)
- Make updates valuable
- Share real progress

## Collecting Feedback

Ship has comment system. Use it to:

**Ask questions:**
- "What price point makes sense for your use case?"
- "What features are must-haves?"
- "How many screenshots per month would you need?"

**Run polls:**
- "Which format do you need most: PNG, JPEG, or WebP?"
- "Would you use webhooks for async processing?"

**Share decisions:**
- "Based on feedback, adding full-page screenshot support"
- "Adjusting rate limits based on your input"

## Converting Ship Subscribers

When you launch:

1. **Email all subscribers:**
   - Thank them for early support
   - Give them early access

## Integration with Your Validation

Ship page = another channel for collecting signups.

**Track separately:**

- Ship page subscribers (Product Hunt)

# Count Ship subscribers + Formspree signups
npm run metrics update <total_count>
```
