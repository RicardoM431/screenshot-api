# ðŸš€ Deploy Now - Autonomous Deployment Guide

Since Railway CLI requires sudo permissions, here are alternative autonomous deployment methods.

---

## Option 1: Vercel CLI (Can Install Locally)

```bash
# Install locally (no sudo needed)
npm install vercel

# Deploy
npx vercel --prod
```

**Vercel will:**
1. Prompt for login (opens browser)
2. Auto-detect project settings
3. Deploy instantly
4. Give you a URL

---

## Option 2: Railway Web Dashboard (Manual but Fast)

1. **Go to**: https://railway.app/new
2. **Click**: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Connect GitHub** (if not already)
4. **Push this repo to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Create GitHub repo first, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/screenshot-api.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```
5. **Select repo** in Railway
6. **Deploy automatically** happens
7. **Get URL** from Railway dashboard

---

## Option 3: Render (One-Click Deploy)

**Create this file first**: `render.yaml`

Then:
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Click "New +"
3. Select "Blueprint"
4. Connect GitHub repo
5. Auto-deploys

---

## Option 4: Netlify (Simple Static + Functions)

```bash
# Install locally
npm install netlify-cli

# Deploy
npx netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended: Vercel (Easiest Autonomous)

Let me deploy via Vercel now:

```bash
npm install vercel
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

This will:
- Install Vercel locally
- Deploy the project
- Return a live URL
- No sudo required

---

## After Deployment

1. **Copy the URL** you receive
2. **Update distribution content**:
   - Replace `[YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL]` in all files
3. **Update Formspree redirect** to point to your URL
4. **Test the site** - visit URL and test form

---

## What Happens Next

Once deployed, you can:
1. Setup Formspree (5 min)
2. Update form ID in `public/index.html`
3. Redeploy (same command)
4. Start validation campaign
